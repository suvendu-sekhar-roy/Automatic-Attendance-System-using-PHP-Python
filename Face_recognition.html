Automated attendance system is a system which will record the status of the student; whether he/she is. present in the class or not. In this paper we propose an automated attendance management system.
Attendance systems are used to track and monitor when employees start and stop work. A time and attendance system enables an employer to monitor their employees working hours and late arrivals, early departures, time taken on breaks and absenteeism.
The device stored the fingerprint impressions of all the faculties and students of an institute through the process of enrolment.

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font:status-bar ;margin: 10mm; font-size: 6mm;">
With the facial images already extracted, cropped, resized and usually converted to grayscale, the face recognition algorithm is responsible for finding characteristics which best describe the image. Identification or facial recognition: it basically compares the input facial image with all facial images from a dataset with the aim to find the user that matches that face. It is basically a 1xN comparison.
We can perceive various appearances adapted all through our lifespan and distinguish faces initially even following quite a while of detachment. This expertise is very vigorous notwithstanding of substantial varieties in visual boost because of evolving condition, maturing and diversions, for example, facial hair, glasses or changes in haircut.
This article aims to quickly build a Python face recognition program to easily train multiple images per person and get started with recognizing known faces in an image.
